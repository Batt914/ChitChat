The app maintains a dynamic list of the user's last 25 Spotify songs, combining:
- ðŸŽ§ Recent 10 songs fetched on initial connection
- ðŸ”„ Real-time updates as new songs are playe
- Songs are stored temporarilyâ€”not downloadable or permanently saved
- This ensures a lightweight, privacy-respecting experience while keeping the chatroom musically alive
- If the list exceeds 25 songs, the oldest track is automatically removed
